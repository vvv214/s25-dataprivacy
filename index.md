# Data Privacy (Spring 2025)

**Note: Under construction. This is a direct copy of the Spring 2022 offering. Everything may change dramatically.** 
How can we learn from data collected from individuals while ensuring their privacy? The course explores this question, starting from privacy attacks to rigorous state-of-the-art solutions using differential privacy. The class will talk about both theoretical foundations and practical issues in real-world applications. **Prerequisites** include basic knowledge of coding (e.g., Python) and be comfortable reading and writing proofs involving algorithms and probability.

## Format:
- There are no exams.
- Each lecture will involve reading one or more papers. Students will also be required to present at least one reading during the semester.
- Students will be evaluated based on class performance and a research project that they complete individually or in groups of size 2. Projects can focus on developing new theory/algorithms, or on implementing/adapting known algorithms to a real application setting. Details on projects are forthcoming.



## Grading: 
- [Paper presentation](papers.md) (20%): During the semester, each student will present a paper for 35 minutes (30min presentation plus 5min Q&A).  If the slides are public or there are videos available online, it is okay to reuse the slides, but make sure you make a high-quality presentation.  Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GPbWKpnKutALnCCEBFBn1HyshOLH8oInoGSfOl7_p9M/edit?usp=sharing) to register.
- Paper review (4 * 5% = 20%): Each student is required to write four paper reviews for papers presented in the course.  Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GPbWKpnKutALnCCEBFBn1HyshOLH8oInoGSfOl7_p9M/edit?usp=sharing) to register.  Submit your paper reviews at: [hotcrp](https://uva-privacycourse22.hotcrp.com/). Please read this [guideline](review.md) before you write a review.  
- Participation (10%): Students are expected to ask/answer questions during the presentation.
- Two assignments (10%) for theory (proofs) and practice (programming)
- [Project](project.md) (solo or a group of 2: 40%): Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19W2DKBKuOnUqCAbyxF12cZb0LaURGI93uBb7eGqKe3Y/edit?usp=sharing) to register your team with a tentative title, and submit your final report at [hotcrp](https://uva-privacycourse22-project.hotcrp.com/).  If desired, teams can utilize office hours to get feedbacks on the project.  
- Grading Scale: We use the [UVA default Grading Basis](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=1153c16fdba41f444f32fb671d961934)
