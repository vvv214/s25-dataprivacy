# Data Privacy (Spring 2025)

How can we learn from data while protecting individuals' privacy? This course addresses that question, starting with privacy attacks and progressing to rigorous, state-of-the-art solutions, such as differential privacy. We will cover both theoretical foundations and practical challenges involved in real-world applications. **Prerequisites** for this course include a basic understanding of machine learning (e.g., knowledge of how large language models work), proficiency in coding (e.g., Python), and familiarity with reading and writing algorithmic proofs that involve probability.

## Grading

- [Paper presentation](papers.md) (30%): During the semester, each student will present two papers, each for 15 minutes, or one paper for 30 minutes.  If the slides are public or there are videos available online, it is okay to reuse the slides, but make sure you make a high-quality presentation.  Students need to email me about the paper title to get an approval first.  
- [Cyber Chats](chats.md) (10%): Each student submits two video recordings each of 5min. The video can investigates a related paper or social event.
- Quiz (20%): There will be two in-class quizes.
- [Project](project.md) (40%):   Students are encouraged utilize office hours to get feedbacks on the project.  Students need to submit project proposals (18%), present a poster (12%), and submit your final report (10%).
- Grading Scale: We use the [UVA default Grading Basis](https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&sys_id=1153c16fdba41f444f32fb671d961934)
