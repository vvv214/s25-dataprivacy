### Academic Integrity

We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the School and in the future. Students are expected to be familiar with the university [honor code](https://honor.virginia.edu/), including the section on [academic fraud](https://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud). 

### On use of GenAI

Utilizing Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, can be a valuable tool for enhancing learning experiences and assisting with everyday tasks. Students are welcome to employ GenAI throughout the course and are not required to disclose its usage specifics. However, students should be aware of certain concerns tied to the use of GenAI, including privacy considerations, ethical implications, and intellectual property concerns. Students are encouraged to read the [FAQ](https://provost.virginia.edu/subsite/genai/faqs) by the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs for more details.


### Students with disabilities or learning needs
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. For general questions please visit the [SDAC website](https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu). If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.


### Religious accommodations
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200.


### Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the [UVA Sexual Violence website](https://cavcare.virginia.edu/) that describes reporting options and resources available.  

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  [UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009) based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. [UVA policy](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010) also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. 

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [Just Report It](https://justreportit.virginia.edu/) or contact [EOCR](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu), the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”)](https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/CAPS) and [Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates](https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/counseling/our-counseling-services) (for students of all genders).  

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 


### Support for your career development
Your career development path may take you beyond the confines of UVA. Perhaps you applied for an internship and your interview is taking place in-person across the country. Maybe you submitted an abstract to a national technical conference and you have been asked to present your work. These are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in travel related to your career development. To that end, if you notify me at least one-week in advance of such an event, I will offer you the choice of either 
(1) completing assignments remotely, or 
(2) delaying assignment, exam, or quiz dates until at least 48 hours after your return. 

This offer comes with caveats: 
(1)	Extensions will not normally be granted for a team activity when only one member is traveling.
(2)	The delay will not extend beyond the last day of finals for the semester.
