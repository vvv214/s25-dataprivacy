## Project

The goal of the project in this course is for you to independently explore data privacy, find a topic that excites you, and dive deeper into it. Through this process, you will learn how to conduct a comprehensive review, manage your time effectively, and write detailed reports.

You are free to use any format for your project deliverables. Whether it is in LaTeX, Google Docs, or any other medium, the key is to convey your findings effectively. There are three types of projects you can choose from:

- **Research**: A research project aims to introduce new ideas or concepts.
- **Evaluation**: An evaluation project involves conducting a thorough evaluation and comparison of a particular topic, such as summarizing and evaluating existing algorithms for a specific problem.
- **Application**: This type of project focuses on applying existing techniques to a new domain or dataset in a meaningful and non-trivial way.

If you choose a research project and invest a lot of effort into organizing and analyzing existing methods—even if your final result is a minor new contribution—that is completely acceptable for this course. Similarly, finding new insights during an evaluation project is highly valued. Please make sure to clearly outline your contributions from both perspectives.

You can work individually or in a group of up to two people, but note that the expected amount of work will double for a group project. Group members will receive the same grade. There is no preference from my side regarding project format, topic, or whether you work alone or in a group.

Some ideas (and you are very welcome to come up with your own idea):

- Evaluate/benchmark existing attacks or methods for differentially private machine learning
- Incorporate public information during differentially private data release
- Differential privacy into new machine learning algorithms
- Privacy attacks of new machine learning algorithms
- Generating differentially private code automatically
- Building a differentially private system (e.g., an SQL engine or a machine learning training system)
- Interplay between differential privacy and fairness or poison attacks

A successful project will include a well-thought-out proposal (your topic may evolve, but the more planning you do early on, the better), a comprehensive survey of related work, and thorough execution. There are three key milestones/deliverables for the project: **Proposal**, **Poster**, and **Final Report**.

### Detailed Descriptions

#### 1. Proposal

In a company setting, you often need to propose your ideas before receiving resources (e.g., budget, headcounts); in a research setting, writing a proposal (e.g., internal or NSF proposals) is key for your research agenda. A well-structured proposal convinces stakeholders that your idea is worth pursuing.

**Objective**  

- To develop a clear project plan and define the scope, goals, and relevance to data privacy.
- To demonstrate feasibility of the proposed projects, via initial results, and/or your track record.
- To receive early feedback and ensure the project is feasible and sufficiently interesting.

**Expectations**  

- Provide a clear description of your topic, objectives, and potential methods.  
- Include references to key papers and datasets you plan to investigate.  
- Propose a realistic timeline for major tasks and deliverables.  
- Propose an actionable evaluation plan (to declare success) and risk mitigation strategies (identify possible challenges and how to overcome them).

#### 2. Poster

Whether at a tech/academic conference or internal company review, posters are a common way to present mid-project progress and foster discussion. They allow you to share insights visually and gather feedback for further development. At the end of this class, we will have students present their projects via posters. We will have two rounds, where students are assigned to stay with their posters and present (if two students work together on a project, both students should engage in the presentation), or walk around listening to others.

**Objective**  

- To visually present your project’s progress, methodology, and preliminary results.  
- To practice distilling complex ideas into clear, visually engaging formats.

**Expectations**  

- Design a poster that communicates the core aspects of your work, including motivation, methods, and findings.  
- Use charts, diagrams, or other visuals to highlight key points.  
- Be prepared to discuss your poster with peers, answer questions, and offer insights.  
- Incorporate feedback received at this stage into your final report.

---

#### 3. Final Report

A final report or publication is the documentation you hand off to a client, the final write-up for a grant-funded project, or the paper you publish after your hard work. It should hopefully adhere to the proposal, but if it deviates, it's also understandable (plans are always subject to change, but it's still useful if we think carefully in the proposal phase). In most cases, there will be an evolving draft, then content from a version of the draft is extracted to form the poster, and the draft can be finalized after incorporating feedbacks from the poster session and final touches.

**Objective**  

- To provide a comprehensive documentation of your project’s motivation, methodology, results, and conclusions.  

**Expectations**  

- Write a clear, well-organized report.  
- Present in-depth analysis, including experiment setups (if any), evaluations, and comparisons.  
- Discuss limitations, open challenges, and potential areas for further exploration.  
- Ensure proper citations of all referenced work.

### Rubric

The overall project grade is divided into three major milestones:

- **Project Proposal (18%)**
- **Poster Presentation (12%)**
- **Final Report (10%)**

Below is a detailed rubric for each component. Students should contact instructor/TAs periodically to ensure the project is related to data privacy. There are also some opportunities to earn bonus points at the end.

#### Bonus Opportunities

These bonus points apply **only** within the project category. That is, your total project score cannot exceed the maximum 40% allocated to the project in the course.

- **LLMs Bonus (+2 points)**  
  If your project is related to large language models (LLMs), you can earn 2 bonus points.  
  *Note*: This area is challenging because LLM research evolves rapidly and often requires substantial computational resources.

- **Popular Poster Vote (+2 points)**  
  During the poster session, each student will select two of their favorite posters (they cannot vote for themselves). The two posters that receive the most votes will each earn 2 bonus points. Votes can be based on any criteria—novelty, clarity, or overall impression.

- **Distinguished Proposal and Project Awards (+2 points)**  
  The instructor will select a few **Distinguished Posters** and **Distinguished Projects** based on overall quality, innovation, and impact.



### Additional Notes

1. **Individual vs. Group Projects**  
   - You may work alone or in a group of two. The expectations (scope, complexity) should be proportionately higher for groups.  
   - Both members of a group receive the same grade, so ensure workload is split evenly.

2. **Research, Evaluation, or Application**  
   If you feel confused about the distinction about these three types, you're on the right track! Indeed, they have a big overlap and are closely connected. A good project always starts from a comprehensive literature review, and some initial benchmarking. Later, if you could find a new idea (sometimes a new idea naturally appears if the benchmarking is comprehensive), you could propose and 'sell' this idea (becomes a 'research' project). If not, you could make the benchmark more comprehensive ('evaluation') or apply these methods to a new domain ('application').

3. **Feedback & Office Hours**  
   - Students are encouraged to bring early drafts and ideas to office hours for feedback.  

4. **Milestones & Time Management**  
   - While the project evolves, **Proposal**, **Poster**, and **Final Report** are key checkpoints. Plan your work to meet these deadlines without rushing.
