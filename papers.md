**Expectations**  

- Each student will present two papers (15 minutes each) or one paper (30 minutes).

- Students should submit the slides at least two days before the presentation date. 
- Before presentation date, students are encouraged to talk to the instructor/TA to get feedback about the slides/presentation.
- Presentations should focus on key aspects such as the paper’s background/related work, objectives, methodology, and high-level take-aways.  
- Critical evaluation of the paper is encouraged (i.e., discuss limitations, open challenges, and potential future work).  
- Presenters should prepare at least two questions or discussion prompts for the class to foster engagement.
- After the presentation, students are encouraged to talk to the instructor to get feedbacks.
